# Trust-Based Distributed Intrusion Detection System for IoT

This repository contains the term paper titled **"A Trust-Based Distributed Intrusion Detection Mechanism for Internet of Things"** prepared for the *Fundamentals of Internet of Things* course.

## 📄 Abstract

With the rapid proliferation of IoT devices, securing such large-scale, heterogeneous, and distributed environments has become increasingly challenging. Traditional centralized intrusion detection systems (IDS) are often inefficient in IoT networks due to resource constraints and latency issues.

This paper presents a **distributed IDS model** that leverages **trust-based mechanisms** to evaluate the behavior of nodes in the network. The proposed approach allows each node to monitor its neighbors, calculate trust scores, and collaboratively identify and isolate malicious entities.

## 🔍 Key Features

- ✅ **Trust Evaluation**: Each node evaluates the trustworthiness of its neighbors based on behavioral metrics.
- 🛡️ **Intrusion Detection**: Malicious activities are detected through aggregated trust data in a distributed manner.
- 📡 **Scalability**: The architecture supports large-scale IoT deployments with minimal communication overhead.
- ⚙️ **Resilience**: The model is resistant to node compromise and can adapt to network changes.
